ML experiments with IoT23 dataset [1]

## 1. (Step 0) Prerequisites (Tools & Technologies)
No  | Name          | Version          | Description
--- |------------   |------------   |-------------
1   | [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)|3.8.8|Programming Language 
2   | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)|0.24.1|Tools for Machine Learning in Python
3   | [NymPy](https://numpy.org/)|1.19.5|Tools for Scientific Computing in Python
4   | [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)|1.2.2|Tools for Data Analysis & Data Manipulation in Python
5   | [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)|3.3.4|Visualization with Python

## 2. (Step 1) Configure Project
1. Download & Extract [IoT23](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23)
2. Clone this repo
3. Install missing libraries
4. Open **config.py** and configure required directories
>* **iot23_scenarios_dir** should point to the home folder, where iot23 scenarios are located 
>* **iot23_attacks_dir** will be used to store files for each attack type from the scenarios files
>* **iot23_experiments_dir** will be used to store experiment files, including trained models and results
5. Run configuration check by running **run_configuration_check.py**
> Make sure the output message says that you may continue with the next step. If not, then check 
> your configuration and fix the errors.

## 3. (Step 2) Extract Attacks from Scenarios
1. Run data extraction by running **run_data_extraction_from_scenarios.py**
> Even though, there are multiple scenarios, files still contain mixed attack and benign traffic.
> For this reason we are going to extract the entries of a similar type into separate files.
> The output files will be stored in **iot23_attacks_dir**.


## 4. (Step 2) Run Demo
1. Run demo by running **run_demo.py**
> 


## 5. (Step 3) Run Experiments
